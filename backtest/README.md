# Backtest

## Overview

After reviewing the [point-in-time scan results](/scans), trade candidates are added to an input file with associated meta data.

I use [Tickblaze](https://tickblaze.com/) which can process the input file for both backtesting and live execution.

See sample input file in this directory.
