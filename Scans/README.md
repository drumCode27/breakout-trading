# Scans

## Overview

I will be following the recommendation of Kristjan Qullamaggie for scanning for breakout candidates. See the Breakout section [here](https://qullamaggie.com/my-3-timeless-setups-that-have-made-me-tens-of-millions/).

The intent is to use poin-in-time scan results to look for trade candidates for a backtest.

## Scan Rules

There will be three point-in-time scan results each week. Each scan will have the common criteria.

- Average Daily Range Percent (ADR) of past 20 days >= 3.5.
- Close above 200 Day Simple Moving Average.
- Share price >= 5.
- Average Daily Dollar Volume of past 20 days >= 6,000,000.
- Average Daily Volume of past 20 days >= 250,000.

The three scans will be:

- Top ranked 100 stocks where Rate of Change for past 20 Days (Roughly 30 Calendar days) >= 30%
- Top ranked 100 stocks where Rate of Change for past 65 Days (Roughly 90 Calendar days) >= 30%
- Top ranked 100 stocks where Rate of Change for past 130 Days (Roughly 180 Calendar days) >= 30%

## Scan Results

The consolidated scan results are in file 20091016-20240517-ScanResults.csv and the source files are in this directory.
