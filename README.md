# Breakout Trading Research

## Overview

Greetings traders!

A bit about me...I am a software engineer and have been active in the algorithmic trading space, trading for myself and working with clients.

I will be using this space to document research done studying the breakout strategies of traders such as
[Kristjan Qullamaggie](https://qullamaggie.com/) and [Mark Minervini](https://www.minervini.com/about.php).

The goal of this project is determine:

- What part of the market cycle should breakouts be traded?
- What are optimal entry and exit techniques and how might they change during different phases of the market cycle?
- What is an optimal position sizing strategy?
